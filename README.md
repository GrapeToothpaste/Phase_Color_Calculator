# Phase_Color_Calculator
These are simple scripts that calculate what color your circuit number should be.
[THIS IS FOR NORTH AMERICAN ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS]


•2 Phase 
-Primarily used for Residential systems.
-Black and Red are the 2 phase colors
-120/240 Volt AC is used
-120V AC is used for most of the house circuits
-240V AC is typically used for large appliances (i.e. stove top, water heater, etc...) 

•3 Phase
-Primarily used for Commercial or Industrial systems.
-Black/Red/Blue are the 3 low voltage phase colors
-Brown/Orange/Yellow are the 3 high voltage phase colors
-120/240 Volt AC is used with low voltage phase colors
-277/480 Volt AC is used with high voltage phase colors
